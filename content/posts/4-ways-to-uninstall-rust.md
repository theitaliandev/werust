Uninstalling Rust is a relatively straightforward process, but it depends on how you installed it in the first place. Here are a 4 common methods to uninstall Rust:

## 1. Using rustup

If you installed Rust using the official Rust installer (rustup), you can use the following command to uninstall it:

```
rustup self uninstall
```

## 2. Using a package manager like apt or yum

If you installed Rust using a package manager like apt or yum, you can use the following command to uninstall it:
```
sudo apt remove rustc
sudo apt autoremove
```
```
sudo yum remove rust
```

## 3. Delete the source directory

If you installed Rust from source, you can remove it by simply deleting the directory where you extracted the source code. You can also remove the environment variables you added to point to the Rust installation.

## 4. Using Homebrew

If you installed Rust using Homebrew package manager for MacOS:

```
brew uninstall rust
```

It's important to note that these commands will remove the Rust programming language, but they will not remove any projects or dependencies you may have installed using Rust. To completely remove a project, you will need to remove the project's directory and any dependencies it may have installed.

Please note that before uninstalling you should check if there is any running process that needs rust and you should stop them accordingly.
