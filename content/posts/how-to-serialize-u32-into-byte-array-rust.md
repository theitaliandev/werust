Serialization is the process of converting data structures or objects state to a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted and reconstructed later. In Rust, there are several libraries that can be used for serialization, such as serde, bincode, and rmp. In this tutorial, we will be using the [bincode library](https://crates.io/crates/bincode) to serialize a u32 into a byte array.

First, you'll need to add the bincode dependency to your Cargo.toml file:

```
[dependencies]
bincode = "1.3.3"
```

Next, import the bincode library in your Rust file:

```
use bincode::{serialize, deserialize};
```

To serialize a u32 into a byte array, use the `serialize` function from the bincode library. The function takes two arguments: the data to be serialized and the type of the data. Here's an example:

```
let data = 42u32;
let bytes = serialize(&data).unwrap();
```

The serialize function returns a `Result` object that contains the serialized data as a `Vec<u8>`. In the example above, we used `unwrap()` to get the underlying `Vec<u8>` and store it in the bytes variable.

To deserialize the byte array back into a u32 use the `deserialize` function from the bincode library. Here's an example:

```
let data: u32 = deserialize(&bytes).unwrap();
```

The deserialize function also takes two arguments: the byte array to be deserialized and the type of the data.

Here's the complete code snippet:

```
use bincode::{serialize, deserialize};

fn main() {
    let data = 42u32;
    let bytes = serialize(&data).unwrap();
    let deserialized: u32 = deserialize(&bytes).unwrap();
    println!("{}", deserialized);
}
```

This code will print "42", which is the initial value of data.

Please note that bincode uses a default configuration for serialization. You can customize the configuration to control the size of the output, the endianness and other options.
